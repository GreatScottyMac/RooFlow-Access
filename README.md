## Welcome to the public gateway repository for the **RooFlow** project.

RooFlow is an **experimental** project that provides an **alternative system prompt implementation** for users of the [Roo Code VS Code extension](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code). It aims to enhance AI-assisted development in VS Code by providing:

*   **Persistent Project Context:** Maintaining a deep understanding of your project across sessions.
*   **Optimized Mode Interactions:** Introducing integrated modes (Architect, Code, Test, Debug, Ask) designed for seamless collaboration.
*   **Reduced Token Consumption:** Through optimized prompts and instructions.

**⚠️ Important Note:** RooFlow **completely replaces** the standard Roo Code system prompts and is **NOT endorsed or supported by Roo Code in any way.**

## Why is RooFlow Private?

RooFlow is an **experimental** project. Due to its nature of replacing the standard Roo Code system prompts, it can sometimes alter the behavior of the Roo Code extension. This has occasionally led to users submitting bug reports to the Roo Code creators when the issue may have been caused by RooFlow prompts instead.

To avoid confusion and ensure that bug reports are directed to the correct project, the Roo Code creators have requested that RooFlow be made private. This helps manage user expectations and ensures that support requests for RooFlow-specific issues come directly to this project's maintainer.

## Requesting Access to the RooFlow Code

If you understand the experimental nature of RooFlow and are interested in accessing the source code, please follow one of these methods:

**Method 1: Start a New Discussion on this Repository (Recommended)**

The most organized way to request access is to start a new discussion on this `RooFlow-Access` repository's Discussions board.

1.  Go to the **[Discussions tab](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow-Access/discussions)** of this repository.
2.  Click the **"New discussion"** button.
3.  Choose a relevant category (e.g., "General" or "Q&A").
4.  Provide a clear title (e.g., "Requesting Access to RooFlow Code").
5.  In the discussion body, please acknowledge that you understand its experimental status and that support for RooFlow-specific issues is provided by this project, not the Roo Code creators.
6.  Click "Start discussion."

**Method 2: Open an Issue on this Repository**

You can also request access by opening a new "Issue" on this `RooFlow-Access` repository.

1.  Go to the **[Issues tab](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/RooFlow-Access/issues)** of this repository.
2.  Click the **"New issue"** button.
3.  Provide a brief title (e.g., "Requesting Access to RooFlow").
4.  In the description, please acknowledge that you understand its experimental status and that support for RooFlow-specific issues is provided by this project, not the Roo Code creators.
5.  Click "Submit new issue."

## Project Information & Concepts

While the code is private, you can learn more about the core ideas behind RooFlow:

*   **Core Purpose:** To provide an alternative, optimized system prompt experience for Roo Code users, focusing on persistent context and streamlined mode interactions.
*   **Relationship with Roo Code:** RooFlow is an **independent** project that replaces the default system prompts of the [Roo Code VS Code extension](https://github.com/RooVetGit/Roo-Code).
*   **Memory Bank:** Learn about the structured approach to maintaining project knowledge through the Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `productContext.md`, `progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`).
*   **Modes:** Understand the purpose of the integrated modes (Architect, Code, Test, Debug, Ask) and how they collaborate.

**Important:** If you are experiencing issues after using RooFlow prompts, you can easily revert to the standard Roo Code system prompts by deleting the `.roo/` folder in your project and optionally installing the [Roo Code Memory Bank](https://github.com/GreatScottyMac/roo-code-memory-bank?tab=readme-ov-file#download-and-run-install-script), which uses the default Roo Code prompts.
